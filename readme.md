# Faddev-Lavier Algorithm for GF(2)

Here we have implemented faddev-lavier algorithm for a GF(2) matrix. 

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joydeep2001/cryptography.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd YourProjectName
   ```

3. **Create the `build` folder** (optional step, but often done by convention):
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

4. **Run CMake to generate the build system** (this step generates the necessary files inside the `build` folder):
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

5. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
6. **Tests**  
    The tests are located inside the test folder. To test the code run the following command:

    ```bash
    ./TestExecutable
    ```
